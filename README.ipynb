    "# DETECTING RECON ATTACKS ON IOT DEVICES\n",
    "\n",
    "### THE PROBLEM\n",
    "\n",
    "As our infrastructures, services and products become ever more reliant on IoT networks, securing the networks through dection is becoming increasingly important.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### THE PROJECT OBJECTIVE\n",
    "\n",
    "Our aim is to develop and test different models to analyze IoT network traffic in order to detect and classify Recon Attacks, a specific kind of cyberattack.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### THE DATASET\n",
    "\n",
    "The CICIOT2023 dataset from West Brunwick University consists in a collection of csv files containing data generated by the traffic monitoring (perfromed through wireshark) of an IoT smart home network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The network is reproduced in a lab and consists of 105 IoT devices. In order to gather network traffic data from actual different kinds of cyberattacks, 33 different cyberattack has been performed on the network and its devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such devices are divided into three categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Victims (67 devices from all over the nework)\n",
    "- Attackers (10 devices, mainly raspberry Pi 4s)\n",
    "- Passives (28 devices not involved in the attacks)\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to the way the network is arranged the researchers were able to label the data with the kind of cyberattack being performed.\n",
    "Subsequently the data was aggregated from .pcap files into a set of .csv files.\n",
    "The end result is a large dataset with 47 features and more than 40 million rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### CURRENT NOTEBOOK SCOPE\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This work will focus on developing deep learning models in order to identify 5 kinds of Recon attacks, attacks meant to identify the network vulnerability.\n",
    "We are interested in this kind as they are the typical first step of the most sophisticated and dangerous kinds of attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook aims at pre-processing and cleaning the data in order to conduct EDA.\n"
